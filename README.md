# password-generator
## Description

This is a password generator developed for the third module's challenge. It works by generating a random password with the press of a button containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. I built this project to learn how something as sensitive as a password generator works and gain a better understanding of the code and algorithms behind it. I was motivated to complete it for the reason that password generators are important when it comes to your privacy and will give you an advantage when it comes to creating a secure password.
